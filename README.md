**Project 1:** 

**Create a Data Model for SSTC** 

**Project Overview**
In this project, you'll create a data model and Power BI report for Seven Sages Tea Company (SSTC) that combines information from all over the company. Your data model will make it possible for the company's CFO to quickly review and analyze which tea beverages sell well and which ones generate the highest profitability.

At the end, you will have applied the key concepts of this course to combine and centralize data that was previously siloed, solving a very common issue facing many companies. More importantly, you'll have a solid foundation to build on when it comes to more complex reporting visualization demands, advanced DAX requirements, or larger data models. No matter how large the data models get as your career progresses, the core principles remain the same.

**Project 2:**

**Building a PowerBI Report for Waggle**

**Project Overview**
On your mark, get set—go!

You work as a business intelligence analyst for Waggle, a startup that makes smart devices for pets. Recently, Waggle has been thrilled by the success of their new Lapdog device, a fitness collar that lets owners track their dog’s steps, alerts them when it’s time for a walk, and even repels fleas! Reviews have been fantastic, sales are growing, and—best of all—the product really works!

This success has led Waggle’s CEO to push for a feline version but there are concerns about its viability. For this reason, the product team distributed 1,000 Lapcat prototypes for field testing. Now, after months of data collection, you have been tasked with delivering a boardroom-ready Power BI report that tells the story of how the Lapcat data compares to findings from the dog collar Lapdog devices. You’re excited because your work will be presented at the highest levels of the company and will either help convince the CEO that Lapcat is the next big thing or a costly mistake to be avoided.

**Project 3:**

**Market Analysis Report for National Clothing Chain**

**Project Description**
An online national clothing chain needs your help creating a targeted marketing campaign. Sales have been flat and they want to lure lost customers back. They want to advertise specific products to specific customers in specific locations, but they don’t know who to target. They have three products in mind:
Shirt: $25
Sweater: $100
Leather Bag: $1,000
They need you to conduct an analysis to determine the best product to advertise to each customer.
